### 1a. Gray to Binary Code Converters Using NAND Gates
**Introduction:** The reflected binary code or Gray code is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit). Gray codes are very useful in the normal sequence of binary numbers generated by the hardware that may cause an error or ambiguity during the transition from one number to the next. So, the Gray code can eliminate this problem easily since only one bit changes its value during any transition between two numbers.

#### Conversion of Gray to Binary Code
Gray codes are used in rotary and optical encoders, Karnaugh maps, and error detection. The hamming distance of two neighbors Gray codes is always 1 and also first Gray code and last Gray code also has Hamming distance is always 1, so it is also calledÂ Cyclic codes. You can convert a Gray code to Binary number using two methods.
